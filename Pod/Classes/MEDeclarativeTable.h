/**
 Describe the structure of your `UITableView`'s sections and rows in an object oriented way. Useful for building small and mostly static tables such as forms, settings, menus, etc... We prefer readability over memory efficiency, so it is not recommended to use this with tables that may have a large number of cells.
 
 Changes to the sections or rows will need a call to a table view's `reloadData` (or similar method to refresh the table) to see the changes go into effect.
